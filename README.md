# Takeaways

## Vue devs

I will be sharing some Vue.js internals. Also some nice tips and tricks and plugins that I use in my projects to make my code even more simpler and manageable.

## Non-vue devs

Hoepfully, you will like the patterns and tools and can bring those to your own framework ecosystem if they do not already exist.
